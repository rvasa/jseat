The easiest way to build JSeat is by using ant with the provided buildfile.

The default -all target will create a _dist_ folder containing the contents setup and built by ant. The default all target should create the following.

  * dist
  * dist/jseat.conf
  * dist/default.rep
  * dist/JSeatExplorer-$version.jar
  * dist/JSeatVisualizer-$version
  * dist/lib
  * dist/lib/jseat-core-$version.jar
  * dist/lib/jseat-gui-core-$version.jar

_$version_ corresponds to the version number. e.g. _JSeatExplorer-0.1.jar_
The _lib_ folder should also contain the following required libraries by JSeat

  * asm-all-3.0.jar
  * colt.jar
  * concurrent.jar
  * jcommon-1.0.10.jar
  * jfreechart-1.0.6.jar
  * jfreechart-1.0.6-swt.jar
  * junit.jar
  * swtgraphics2d.jar
  * xpp3-1.1.4c.jar
  * xpp3_min-1.1.3.4.jar
  * xstream-1.2.2.jar
