#summary How to build JSeat from source code.
#labels building,sourcecode

= Introduction =

The easiest way to build JSeat is by using [http://ant.apache.org/ Apache Ant] with the provided buildfile.

{{{ ant -buildfile build.xml }}} // will use the default all target.

The default -all target will create a _dist_ folder containing the contents setup and built by ant. The default all target should create the following.

  * dist
  * dist/jseat.conf
  * dist/default.rep
  * dist/JSeatExplorer-$version.jar
  * dist/JSeatVisualizer-$version
  * dist/lib
  * dist/lib/jseat-core-$version.jar
  * dist/lib/jseat-gui-core-$version.jar

_$version_ corresponds to the version number. e.g. _JSeatExplorer-0.1.jar_
The _lib_ folder should also contain the following required libraries by JSeat

  * asm-all-3.0.jar
  * colt.jar
  * concurrent.jar
  * jcommon-1.0.10.jar
  * jfreechart-1.0.6.jar
  * _jfreechart-1.0.6-swt.jar_
  * _swtgraphics2d.jar_
  * junit.jar
  * xpp3-1.1.4c.jar
  * xpp3_min-1.1.3.4.jar
  * xstream-1.2.2.jar

*Note:* The two jar files labeled in italics are operating system dependent (because the implementation of SWT is OS specific). As such, you need to replace these two files with the appopriate files for your operating which are provided here; [http://jseat.googlecode.com/files/jfreechart-swt-3.3-win32-x86.zip Windows], [http://jseat.googlecode.com/files/jfreechart-swt-3.3-carbon-macosx.zip Mac OSX] or [http://jseat.googlecode.com/files/jfreechart-swt-3.3-gtk-linux-x86.zip Linux].
